            <h3>I am currently an undergraduate student at UIUC studying Electrical Engineering! I am interested in pursuing a career path in Aerospace, such as satelites, control systems, robotic equipment, and more. I also very much enjoy Mechanical design, and wish to combine this with Electrical design in my future, like with Mechatronics. </h3>        
            <br>
            <h3>While Engineering is my passion, I also love biking, playing video games, exploring the outdoors, collecting cool stuff, and building/launching model rockets. I also enjoy 3D Printing and designing models using CAD. </h3>

Furthermore, each rider is required to fundraise at least $4,000 to be donated to cancer related organizations. I was a rider on the 2020 and 2021 Bike America Team, where the 2020 ride was cancelled, but the 
                2021 team successfully made the 4,900 mile trek! I am also a Logistics Officer, where I will help in route planning, stayovers, team lifestyle, and other logistical tasks.</h3>
